# Tailpattern

Tails files of a given pattern in a directory, including files that don't exist yet.

Done in haskell, mostly because doing asynchronous callbacks is a pain in python;
and the alternative was basically this, C++, or node. I suppose Java. Maybe that
one next time.

Wanted to get a better idea of how to do this type of program in haskell, so this
is why it's in haskell.
